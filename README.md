# AI-TicTacToe
Designed with JS and no frameworks, it was, originally, a repository for a little experiment of a neural network able to adapt and learn the players patterns in order to beat him. 
Because of the how random rock, paper and scissors is, I decided to swap the project to a TicTacToe AI, anyway, this is not a normal Tic Tac Toe, here, there are different piece sizes
